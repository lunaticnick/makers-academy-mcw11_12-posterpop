How often have you seen the poster of an event/exhibition on the street/tube, taken a picture of it thinking "I'd love to go there/do this!" and forgotten all about the event?

posterpop! is an app that uses text recognition to allow the user to photograph that poster and save the link for the event's website. That link is then stored in the user's profile and is shown on the app page. The user can then click on it to get redirected to the event's website at a later time.
